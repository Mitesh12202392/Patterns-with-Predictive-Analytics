# Patterns-with-Predictive-Analytics

🎉 Leveraging Predictive Analytics and Clustering with the faithful Dataset in R 📊

Delving into the fascinating world of Predictive Analytics and Clustering, I recently worked on a project using R's built-in faithful dataset! 🚀

🔍 Project Highlights:

1️⃣ Predictive Analytics:
Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes Models to classify eruption durations and predict waiting times.
Focused on feature scaling, data preprocessing, and model evaluation to uncover the relationship between eruption durations and waiting times.

2️⃣ Clustering Techniques:
Used K-Means Clustering to group observations based on eruption and waiting characteristics, identifying meaningful patterns in the data.
Explored Hierarchical Clustering and visualized dendrograms to understand hierarchical relationships and cluster structures.

💡 Key Insights:
Mastered data preprocessing and normalization techniques essential for building accurate models.
Applied and compared classification models (KNN and Naive Bayes) alongside clustering techniques (K-Means and Hierarchical).
Visualized clustering results to reveal hidden patterns and actionable insights.
This project showcases how R can be a powerful tool for both supervised learning and unsupervised data exploration! 🌟
